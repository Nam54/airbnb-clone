# Airbnb clone
  This is a project that built to practice and improve my JavaScript (ReactJS, NodeJS).
  The UI idea have been copied from [Aibnb](https://airbnb.com)

## Technologies
  ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, JWT,...

## Demo
  For frontend, I deployed this one on [Demo](https://airbnb-mern-fe.vercel.app/)
  With back-end, you need to download repo and take steps in Installation section.

## Installation
First, clone the project:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nam-rgba/airbnb-mern.git
  ```
Then open terminal that target to 'airbnb-api-v2' folder and run script for back-end:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run start
  ```
Same with another terminal in 'airbnb-client' folder:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
In the end, you can see my product on [localhost](http://localhost:5173/)
